## Task 3: Diamond Model Elements

| Vertex | Findings | Evidence |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Adversary** | Cyber threat actors, Which is supported by the People’s Republic of China (PRC). | “People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber threat actors…” |
| **Infrastructure** | They use backbone routers of major telecommunications providers, including PE and CE routers, along with other compromised network devices. | “focus on large backbone routers… as well as provider edge (PE) and customer edge (CE) routers.” |
| **Capability** | They modify routers to maintain persistent long-term access within networks. | “actors often modify routers to maintain persistent, long-term access to networks.” |
| **Victim** | They target networks worldwide, including telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military sectors. | “targeting networks globally, including telecommunications, government, transportation, lodging, and military…” |



## Task 5: Threat Actor Profile Summary

The threat actors in this report are state-sponsored hackers supported by the People’s Republic of China (PRC). According to the report these actors have been performing the operations globally since 2021. Their activity overlaps with commonly reported groups, including Salt Typhoon, Operator Panda, RedMike, UNC5807, and GhostEmperor. These threat groups are funded by Chinese technology companies such as Beijing Huanyu Tianqiong Information Technology Co., Ltd., Sichuan Zhixin Ruijie Network Technology Co., Ltd., and Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., Ltd. These companies work with China’s intelligence agencies, the Ministry of State Security and the People’s Liberation Army.

The attackers targeted many sectors around the world, including government departments, transportation services, lodging networks, and military systems. However, their main focus was on telecommunications companies and internet service providers. They continued attacks in several countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and other regions.

The attack began by targeting large backbone routers and edge routers used by telecom companies. The attackers also used already compromised devices to move deeper inside the networks. A major part of their strategy involved modifying router settings so they could stay inside the systems for a long time without being detected. This long-term access allowed them to steal data and track communications and movement across different networks.

In the Diamond Model, the adversary is PRC sponsored APT groups. Their infrastructure includes backbone routers, PE/CE routers, and compromised devices. Their capabilities include router modification, long-term access. The victims include telecom companies, transportation, military and other industries worldwide.

The report recommends several steps to reduce the risk of these attacks. Organizations should regularly update their routers and network devices to. They should check for unusual changes in router configurations and watch for unexpected network activity that show unauthorized access. Using strong authentication can also help prevent attackers from moving through systems. These actions can make it harder for APT actors to maintain long-term access and reduce the chance of similar threats.


## Task 6: Reflection

How does the Diamond Model help in understanding threat actors?

Ans: The diamond model helps by dividing attack in four parts: Adversary (who is behind the attack), Capability (Malware or technique used), Infrastructure (tools, servers, domains used) and Victim (who is affected by attack). This makes it easier to understand how different elements are connected to each other. And also it helps to understand how attack works.

What challenges did you face in identifying each vertex? 

Ans: One challenge i face was to identify Capability and Infrastructure. It was so confusing 
to identify each. However, after reading the summary for 4-5 times and spending almost 45 mins i was able to identify it.

How could this model support proactive defense strategies?

Ans: The Diamond Model can help organizations to improve their security by analyzing what tools attackers are using. It also gives idea about what techniques attacker are using so they can focus on it more deeply. Moreover, it also shows that which areas are highly at risk so organizations can prepare and stronger their security in that particular areas.
